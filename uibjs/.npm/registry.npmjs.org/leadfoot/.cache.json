Through this test suite we have discovered and reported\nover 15 defects to upstream WebDriver server implementers.\n\nLeadfoot currently detects and corrects known defects in the following remote drivers:\n\n* InternetExplorerDriver 2.41.0\n* FirefoxDriver 2.41.0\n* ChromeDriver 2.9\n* SafariDriver 2.41.0\n* Selendroid 0.9.0\n* ios-driver 0.6.6\n\nLeadfoot is tested against IE8+ and all other modern browsers.\n\n## Using Leadfoot\n\nLeadfoot can be installed and used as a stand-alone WebDriver library from npm by running `npm install leadfoot`.\nHowever, we recommend using Leadfoot through the [Intern testing framework](http://theintern.io), which provides you\nwith all of the tools you need to write robust unit and functional tests. Follow the instructions on\n[writing functional tests with Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Writing-Tests-with-Intern#functional-testing)\nto learn how to use Leadfoot with Intern.\n\n## WD.js compatibility\n\nA compatibility layer is provided to expose APIs that are signature-compatible with the variant of WD.js 0.2.2 used by\nIntern 1. Use of these APIs will emit deprecation warnings. This compatibility layer will be removed in a future\nrelease.\n\n## License\n\nLeadfoot is available under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE).
