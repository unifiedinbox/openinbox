This can be provided by setting properties on tunnels or via environment variables. The tunnels use the following environment variables:\n\nTunnel class         | Environment variables\n---------------------|----------------------------------------------------\n`BrowserStackTunnel` | `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME`, `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY`\n`SauceLabsTunnel`    | `SAUCE_USERNAME`, `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`\n`TestingBotTunnel`   | `TESTINGBOT_KEY`, `TESTINGBOT_SECRET`\n\nOther properties, such as the local port the tunnel should serve on or the URL of a proxy server the tunnel should go through, can be passed to a tunnel constructor or set on a tunnel instance. See the pages for [Tunnel](Tunnel.html) and the tunnel subclasses for available properties.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo create a new tunnel, import the desired tunnel class, create a new instance, and call its `start` method. `start` returns a Promise that resolves when the tunnel has successfully started. For example, to create a new Sauce Labs tunnel:\n\n```js\nvar SauceLabsTunnel = require('digdug/SauceLabsTunnel');\nvar tunnel = new SauceLabsTunnel();\ntunnel.start().then(function () {\n\t// interact with the WebDriver server at tunnel.clientUrl\n});\n```\n\nOnce a tunnel has been started, a test runner interacts with it as described in the service's documentation. The Sauce Labs and TestingBot executables start a WebDriver server on localhost that the test client communicates with. To interact with BrowserStack, a test client will connect to `hub.browserstack.com` after the tunnel has started.\n\nThe tunnel classes also provide a `sendJobState` convenience method to let the remote service know whether a test session passed or failed. This method accepts a session ID and an object containing service-specific data, and it returns a Promise that resolves if the job state was successfully updated.\n\n```js\ntunnel.sendJobState(sessionId, { success: true });\n```\n\nWhen testing is finished, call the tunnel's `stop` method to cleanly shut it down. This method returns a Promise that is resolved when the service tunnel executable has exited.\n\n```js\ntunnel.stop().then(function () {\n\t// the tunnel has been shut down\n});\n```\n\n## License\n\nDig Dug is available under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE).
