intersect\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/intersect.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/intersect)\n[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/intersect.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/intersect)\n\n[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/intersect.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/intersect)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar intersect = require('intersect');\n\nvar a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];\nvar b = ['nope', 'bar', 'baz'];\n\nconsole.log(intersect(a, b));\n// => ['bar', 'baz']\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do\n\n```bash\n$ npm install intersect\n```\n\nWith [component](https://github.com/component/component) do\n\n```bash\n$ component install juliangruber/intersect\n```\n\n## API\n\n### intersect(a, b)\n\nFind the intersection of arrays `a` and `b`. The individual arrays are expected to be sets, i.e. there's no duplicate elements in them.\n\n### intersect(arrays)\n\nYou can also pass an array of arrays as a single argument, to get the intersection of `n` arrays.\n\n### intersect.big(a, b)\n\nThis module contains an alternative intersection algorithm by @minuteman3, better suited for intersecting big arrays.\n\nThe implementations *might* compare like this, depending on your host environment:\n\n![graph of intersect](http://minuteman3.github.io/minuteman3/graph.svg)\n\n## License\n\n(MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Julian Gruber &lt;julian@juliangruber.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
