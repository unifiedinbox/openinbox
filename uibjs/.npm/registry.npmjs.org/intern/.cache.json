It can be used to test *any* JavaScript code. Its functional\ntesting capabilities can even be used to test non-JavaScript Web and mobile apps, if you really want.\n\nLearn more about Intern at http://theintern.io.\n\n## Quick start\n\n1. Install from npm\n\n   ```\n   cd /my/project/root\n   npm install intern --save-dev\n   ```\n\n2. Create a copy of the [example configuration file](https://github.com/theintern/intern/blob/master/tests/example.intern.js) in your package’s test directory and edit appropriately. See the\n[configuration documentation](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Configuring-Intern) for a list of all available\noptions.\n\n   ```\n   mkdir tests ; cp node_modules/intern/tests/example.intern.js tests/intern.js\n   ```\n\n3. Verify your configuration works by running the Node.js client and seeing that no errors are output.\n\n   ```\n   node_modules/.bin/intern-client config=tests/intern\n   ```\n\n4. Start writing tests! See the [writing tests](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Writing-Tests-With-Intern) documentation\nand the [Intern tutorial](https://github.com/theintern/intern-tutorial) to learn how.\n\n## More information\n\n* [Web site](http://theintern.io)\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki)\n* [Support](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Support)\n\n## Do you hate kittens and love old IE?\n\nIf you need to support IE 6–8, there is also a\n[version of Intern for legacy browsers](https://github.com/theintern/intern/tree/geezer \"geezer branch\").\n\n## License\n\nIntern is available under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE).
